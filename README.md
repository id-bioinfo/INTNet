INTNet
=====
Multi-task multilabel deep neural networks for identification and classification of integrons.

INTNet is designed to identify and classify integron integrases, predict bacterial hosts (multi-label), and associate ARGs (multi-label) with integrons. This versatile tool supports a range of input types including:
* Long Amino Acid Sequences (Full Length/Contigs)
* Long Nucleotide Sequences
* Short Amino Acid Reads (30-50 aa)
* Short Nucleotide Reads (100-150 nt)

All inputs should be in FASTA format.
