INTNet
=====
Multi-task multilabel deep neural networks for identification and classification of integrons

INTNet indentifies and classifies of integron integrease, predict bacterial hosts (multi-label) and the associate ARGs (multi-label) of integron. The input can be long amino acid sequences(full length/contigs), long nucleotide sequences, short amino acid reads (30-50aa), short nucleotide reads (100-150nt) in fasta format. INTNet includes INTNet-s for short reads prediction and INTNet-l for long sequences prediction.
